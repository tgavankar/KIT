The Kitchen Inventory Tracker (KIT) is a tool that can be used to keep track of
what you need to buy the next time from the grocery store. It is primarily 
designed and tested for blind users, and so different flavors allow usage of a
packaged screen reader (NVDA), or a simple console version to use your own 
screen reader. There is also a simple GUI version incase you do not wish to use
the console.

An internet connection is suggested (as KIT will try to pull UPC info from 
online if it is not locally found), but if an internet connection is not 
detected, then KIT will ask you to input information for the item (name and
amount).

A barcode scanner is also suggested, but not required. A keyboard (typing in 
the UPC) can easily replace a barcode scanner.

    * Usecase
    Scan items into database without scanning into inventory. Useful if 
    internet access is limited or if you don't want to type in the names of
    items while performing inventory scanning. You can also overwrite the name
    and amount of items by modifying it in edit mode. For example, if you have
    2-3 different types of plastic wrap, you can rename each one to simply
    be "plastic wrap" as a reminder for when you go to the grocery store since
    you don't care about the exact company.
